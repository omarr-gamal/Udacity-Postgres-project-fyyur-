# Udacity-Postgres-project-fyyur-
This repository is my project of Udacity's Advanced Web Development NanoDegree after completing all TODOs, setting all configurations and wiring
everything up. The project is about SQL Databases and building the website's backend and managing its database. 

You can download the project files inside the "Starter Content"
file, follow the instructions in the README.md and install the required dependencies in order to view the website locally.
